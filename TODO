    - code: V
    - example: V
    - test: copy from pylops
    - imaging: X add code and example

- Iterative Marchenko:
    - code: V
    - example: V
    - test: X
    - imaging: X

- Rayleigh-Marchenko:
    - code: V
    - example: V
    - test: X
    - imaging: X (need to move codes from script to library!

- TMM/demultiple:
    - code: X  (Need to fix code with multiple sources)
    - example: X

    - imaging: X

- Marchenko missing:
    - code: X  (need to take away Rollop)
    - example: X
    - test: X
    - imaging: X


- Change all codes to work without Roll and do eveything to do with flipping from -T to T to nonphysical panel used for efficiency inside
